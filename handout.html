        <h1>Research Data Security 101</h1>
        <h2>John D. Martin III</h2>
        <p>2024-11-18</p>
        <p>This presentation covers the critical aspects of securing research data, emphasizing the protection of sensitive information such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). It highlights the need for aligning research data security practices with industry standards, treating research data as a vital institutional asset, and ensuring compliance with Federal guidelines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Questions for Consideration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is our research data treated as a strategic institutional asset?</li>
            <li>Do our current data security practices align with industry standards like NIST?</li>
            <li>How are we minimizing the risks associated with handling PII and PHI?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Call to Action: Strengthening Data Security and Data Integrity</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Recognize Research Data as a Strategic Asset:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Research data is a critical institutional asset with value extending beyond individual projects. Its integrity and security are foundational not only for compliance but also for the institution’s reputation, research credibility, and contributions to AI and machine learning.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Invest in Secure Infrastructure to Ensure Data Integrity:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Institutions must invest in secure data infrastructure, including tools and systems that protect data at every stage of its lifecycle. Secure storage, identity management, and continuous monitoring are essential for preventing breaches and ensuring data accuracy and reliability.</li>
            <li>Investments in both technology and training are necessary to support data security and data integrity. Well-trained staff are crucial for implementing processes that prevent unauthorized changes and ensure consistent, accurate data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Build a Culture of Security and Integrity:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data security and data integrity must be seen as interconnected responsibilities embedded in everyday research activities. Embedding strong security practices helps maintain the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the data.</li>
            <li>Regular training sessions should focus on the dual goals of protecting data from external threats and ensuring transparency in any internal data manipulation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Foster Collaboration Between Research and IT Teams:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stronger collaboration between research and IT teams is essential for developing solutions that address both security and integrity needs. Effective collaboration leads to systems that prevent unauthorized access and support rigorous version control and auditing.</li>
            <li>Form a cross-functional data security and integrity committee with representatives from research, IT, and compliance to oversee the implementation of measures that uphold both principles.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Standardize Data Governance to Enhance Security and Integrity:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear, standardized data governance policies must be applied across all departments. These policies should include protocols for secure data handling and integrity checks, reducing inconsistencies and ensuring accurate, protected data throughout its lifecycle.</li>
            <li>Standardized governance practices not only aid in compliance but also help maintain data quality, making it easier to trace and verify data origins and modifications.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Proactively Adapt to Emerging Threats:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Institutions must proactively update security measures to address the evolving threat landscape while also implementing checks that safeguard data integrity. Regular updates to protocols and risk assessments help prevent breaches and detect potential data inaccuracies early.</li>
            <li>Participation in threat intelligence sharing networks with other research institutions provides valuable insights into emerging risks that could compromise both data security and integrity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Leadership’s Role in Supporting Security and Integrity Initiatives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Institutional leadership is crucial in prioritizing data security and integrity efforts. Their support is key to resource allocation, standardizing practices, and fostering a culture that values data as a reliable and protected asset.</li>
            <li>Leaders must champion the alignment of security and integrity efforts, understanding that robust data security practices are fundamental to maintaining high data quality and reliability.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
        <p>PII includes any data that can identify an individual, such as names, addresses, and social security numbers. Its protection is governed by regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

        <h3>Protected Health Information (PHI)</h3>
        <p>PHI, as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), includes medical records, health insurance information, and other health-related data linked to an individual’s identity. HIPAA mandates strict handling and consent requirements for PHI.</p>

        <h3>Data Governance</h3>
        <p>Data governance refers to the framework of policies and procedures that dictate how data is managed, shared, and protected within an organization. Effective data governance ensures compliance, data quality, and security.</p>

        <h3>NIST Standards</h3>
        <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines for information security through publications like NIST SP 800-53. These guidelines help institutions implement robust security controls and align with Federal requirements.</p>
